This project uses a dedicated conda environment. To reproduce the environment used for the analysis, run: 



conda env create -f environment.yml

conda activate zincsoap-ml



The environment includes the core scientific Python stack (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn), HyperSpy for SEM-EDS hyperspectral data processing, and JupyterLab for running the analysis notebooks.
